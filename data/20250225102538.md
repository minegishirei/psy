Here are some psychological principles that can be derived from the text:

## 効果: Availability Heuristic
- action: People tend to overestimate the importance or likelihood of information that is readily available.
- content: This phenomenon occurs because people tend to judge the likelihood of an event based on how easily examples come to mind.
- effect: As a result, people may make irrational decisions or judgments based on incomplete information.
- example: Overestimating the likelihood of a plane crash because a recent crash is still fresh in one's memory.

## 効果: The Law of Primacy
- action: People tend to remember the first piece of information they receive about a person or topic more than subsequent information.
- content: This phenomenon occurs because the first information creates a strong impression that is difficult to change.
- effect: As a result, people may form biased opinions or make judgments based on incomplete information.
- example: Forming an opinion about a person based on the first impression, even if subsequent interactions contradict it.

## 効果: The Dunning-Kruger Effect
- action: People who are incompetent in a particular domain tend to overestimate their abilities and performance.
- content: This phenomenon occurs because they lack the knowledge and skills to recognize their own incompetence.
- effect: As a result, people may take on tasks they are not qualified for, leading to poor performance and potential harm.
- example: A person who has never cooked before attempting to prepare a complex meal for a large group, and overestimating their ability to do so.
