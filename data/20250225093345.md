Here are some practical psychological principles that can be derived from the article:

**1. Levinson's Life Cycle Research**

* Effect: People's lives are composed of approximately 25-year periods, with transitional periods (around 5 years) that connect each stage.
* Content: Levinson's research suggests that each stage has its own unique characteristics, and transitions between stages involve changes in internal and external worlds.
* Example: The three transitional periods are: (1) from youth to adulthood (20-25 years old), (2) from mid-life to old age (40-45 years old), and (3) from old age to late life (60-65 years old).

**2. Mid-Life Crisis**

* Effect: Middle-aged individuals experience a crisis due to conflicts between youth and old age, destruction and creation, masculinity and femininity, and attachment and separation.
* Content: This crisis can lead to an identity crisis, and it is essential to have the toughness and flexibility to adapt to changes.
* Example: The "Empty Nest Syndrome" is a type of mid-life crisis experienced by women in their 40s and 50s who feel a sense of loss when their children leave home.

**3. Successful Aging**

* Effect: Successful aging is characterized by a sense of growth, development, and well-being, despite physical decline.
* Content: Support from social networks, such as social support and formal/informal support, is crucial for successful aging.
* Example: Theories such as Selective Optimization with Compensation, Social Emotional Selectivity, Disengagement Theory, Activity Theory, Continuity Theory, and Transcendence Theory can help individuals adapt to aging and achieve successful aging.

These principles can be applied in various aspects of life, such as personal growth, relationships, and career development.
