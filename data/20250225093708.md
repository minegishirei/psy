Here are some practical psychological effects that can be derived from the article:

**1. Joint Attention Effect**
When an infant points to an object, it's not just a random gesture. They are trying to share their attention with the caregiver, which is a precursor to language development and social understanding.

**2. Language Development Effect**
Babbling (repeating sounds) is an important milestone in language development. It's not just a meaningless sound; it's a step towards forming words and sentences.

**3. Emotional Regulation Effect**
Infants as young as six months old can exhibit emotions like anger, fear, and surprise. Recognizing and responding to these emotions is crucial for emotional regulation and development.

**4. Object Permanence Effect**
Infants understand that objects still exist even when they're out of sight. This concept, known as object permanence, is essential for problem-solving and cognitive development.

**5. Imitation Effect**
Infants learn by imitating others, which is a fundamental aspect of social learning and development. Caregivers can encourage imitation by modeling behaviors and responding to the infant's attempts to imitate.

**6. Self-Awareness Effect**
Infants develop a sense of self-awareness through interactions with caregivers. This self-awareness is essential for cognitive, social, and emotional development.

**7. DOHaD Hypothesis Effect**
The prenatal environment and early life experiences can have a lasting impact on an individual's health and development. This highlights the importance of a healthy pregnancy and early childhood experiences.

These effects can inform caregiving practices, education, and research in the field of developmental psychology.
