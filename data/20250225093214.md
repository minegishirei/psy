Here are some practical psychological principles that can be derived from the article:

**1. Classical Conditioning Effect**
Action: Associating two stimuli to elicit a response
Content: Ivan Pavlov's classical conditioning theory, where a neutral stimulus is paired with an unconditioned stimulus to elicit an unconditioned response.
Effect: The neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus, eliciting a conditioned response.
Example: A dog salivates when it hears a bell ring, because it associates the bell with food.

**2. Social Learning Theory**
Action: Observing and imitating others' behavior
Content: Albert Bandura's social learning theory, which states that people learn new behaviors by observing and imitating others.
Effect: Observers may adopt the modeled behavior, even if it's not reinforced.
Example: A child watches a parent smoke and may start smoking themselves.

**3. Cognitive Dissonance Theory**
Action: Holding two conflicting cognitions or attitudes
Content: Leon Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory, which states that people experience discomfort when they hold two contradictory beliefs or attitudes.
Effect: Individuals may change their attitudes or behaviors to reduce the dissonance.
Example: A person who smokes but knows it's harmful may experience dissonance and try to quit smoking.

**4. Self-Efficacy Theory**
Action: Believing in one's ability to achieve a goal
Content: Albert Bandura's self-efficacy theory, which states that people's beliefs about their abilities influence their motivation and behavior.
Effect: Individuals with high self-efficacy are more likely to set goals and take action to achieve them.
Example: A student who believes they can pass an exam is more likely to study and take the exam.

**5. Halo Effect**
Action: Judging someone based on a single trait or characteristic
Content: The halo effect, which is a cognitive bias where a positive impression of someone in one area influences our overall judgment of them.
Effect: We may overestimate or underestimate someone's abilities based on a single trait.
Example: A teacher who likes a student's smile may assume they are also intelligent and friendly.

These are just a few examples of the many psychological principles that can be derived from the article.
