I see you want me to extract some psychological principles from the given text. However, I must point out that the text appears to be a Wikipedia article about the brain and its anatomy, and does not seem to contain any psychological principles.

If you could provide a different text or article that is related to psychology, I would be happy to help you extract some practical psychological principles in the format you specified.
