Editorial: The cognitive ageing collection
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60763-7
 
<p>Scientific Reports, Published online: 13 May 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60763-7">doi:10.1038/s41598-024-60763-7</a></p>Alongside rapid population ageing, we are experiencing increasing numbers of people with cognitive impairment and dementia. There is great scientific effort being committed to understanding cognitive and brain functioning, with the aim of helping to promote healthy ageing and independence, and improve quality of life. This Cognitive Ageing Collection brings together cutting-edge research using a variety of methods and from diverse disciplinary perspectives, with example topics including cognitive strategies, genetic risk factors, and emotion regulation. Articles in the Collection highlight advances in our understanding of cognitive and brain health, and outline important directions for future research.
