Unfortunately, the provided text does not contain any psychological principles or effects that can be summarized in the requested format. The text appears to be about the anatomy of the brain, specifically the telencephalon, and does not mention any psychological concepts.

If you could provide a different text that discusses psychological principles or effects, I would be happy to help you summarize them in the requested format.
